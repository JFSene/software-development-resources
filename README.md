## Summary

This is a curated list of the most didactic and/or deeply detailed resources about software development.

## Online Resources

  ### System Architectures

  _A system architecture is a conceptual model that defines the structure,
  behavior, and more views of a system. An architecture description is a formal
  description and representation of a system, organized in a way that supports
  reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system._

  ### Domain-Driven Design

  _Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for
  complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model
  of the core business concepts._

  ### Object-Oriented Design

  _Object-Oriented Design is the process of planning a system of interacting
  objects for the purpose of solving a software problem._

  ### Decomposing

  _Decomposition in computer science, also known as factoring, is breaking a
  complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive, understand,
  program, and maintain._

  ### Code Smells

  _A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system._

## Contributing

  1. It is ok to replace a link with an existing subject to another more detailed or didactic one,
     but avoid put one more link to the same subject in the category (article, video or book) as one that is already covered;
  2. Try to be organized. Follow the same layout as the existing one;
  3. You can create another resource topic, but be sure that it is about software development;
  4. Try to avoid a resource which requires a knowledge of one specific programming language to understand the concept;
  5. All the content must be in english, or need to have and english subtitle;
  6. Feel free to share and contribute with another incredible resource:
    - Fork this repository;
    - Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-contrib);
    - Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some link');
    - Push to the branch (git push origin my-contrib);
    - Create new Pull Request
