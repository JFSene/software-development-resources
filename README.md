## Summary

This is a curated list of the most didactic and/or deeply detailed resources about software development.

## Online Resources

  ### System Architectures

  _A system architecture is a conceptual model that defines the structure,
  behavior, and more views of a system. An architecture description is a formal
  description and representation of a system, organized in a way that supports
  reasoning about the structures and behaviors of the system._

  ### Architectural Patterns

  _Is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software
  architecture within a given context. Architectural patterns are similar to software
  design pattern but have a broader scope._

  ### Domain-Driven Design

  _Domain-driven design (DDD) is an approach to developing software for
  complex needs by deeply connecting the implementation to an evolving model
  of the core business concepts._

  ### Object-Oriented Design

  _Object-Oriented Design is the process of planning a system of interacting
  objects for the purpose of solving a software problem._

  ### Decomposing

  _Decomposition in computer science, also known as factoring, is breaking a
  complex problem or system into parts that are easier to conceive, understand,
  program, and maintain._

  ### Code Smells

  _A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system._

## Contributing

  1. It is ok to replace a link of an existing subject to another more detailed or didactic one;
  2. Try to be organized. Follow the same layout as the existing one;
  3. You can create another resource topic, but be sure that it is about software development;
  4. Try to avoid a resource which requires a knowledge of one specific programming language to understand the concept;
  5. All the content must be in English or must have an English subtitle;
  6. Feel free to share and contribute with another incredible resource:

  - Fork this repository;
  - Create your feature branch (git checkout -b my-contrib);
  - Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some link');
  - Push to the branch (git push origin my-contrib);
  - Create new Pull Request
